<p>
I'm a software engineer who's very passionate about <b>automation</b> and <b>performance</b>.
</p>

<p>
My career got started in an agency where I had the pleasure of working with a great team of engineers, designers and marketeers. Here I helped work on <a href="http://www.fork-cms.com/" target="_blank">Fork CMS</a>. I also had my first experience within the startup world by helping to build <a href="http://myri.se/" target="_blank">Myrise</a>.
</p>

<p>
An opportunity followed to move to London and work for <a href="https://mintdigital.com/" target="_blank">Mint Digital</a> where I had the pleasure of working on projects like <a href="https://sticky9.com/" target="_blank">Sticky9</a>, the interactive TV programme <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Was_It_Something_I_Said%3F_(TV_series)" target="_blank">Was It Something I Said</a> and the NHS's <a href="https://gp-patient.co.uk/" target="_blank">GP Patient Survey</a> website. What started as a side project at Mint Digital, I also worked on the foundations of <a href="https://boomf.com/" target="_blank">Boomf</a> which I later joined full-time to help with it's growth.
</p>

<p>
I am currently working as a <b>Platform Reliability Engineer</b> at <a href="https://www.lostmy.name/" target="_blank">Lost My Name</a> where I focus on <b>performance</b>, <b>reliability</b> and <b>scalability</b> of the platform. This is the core of the business which enables the creatives to get their work published and consumed by the customers.
